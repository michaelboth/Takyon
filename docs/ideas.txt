To DO
  - Rename TcpSocket to SocketTcp, and UdpSocket to SocketUdp
  - Windows CUDA
  - Windows testing scripts
  - BUG: OSX ephemeral sockets
  - ISSUE: Need more CUDA events with InterProcess
  - Ask OFA if they no longer support Verbs implementations anymore. Do they still support the API spec? How is Intel and Mellanox supported with implementations?
  - README.md:
    - Takyon 2.x
    - The most flexible and easy HetComm 
    - The basics: primary sockets and RDMA, secondary: also allow thread, mmap
    - Grid of features: thread, mmap, & sockets and RDMA
  - GETTING_STARTED.txt
  - Examples
    - throughput: show Gb/sec & GB/sec

Interconnects (WebSite)
  + InterThread  (PBM, SGEs, oneWayWrite, oneWayRead, zeroByteMessage, >4GB, GPU)
  - InterProcess (PBM, SGEs, oneWayWrite, oneWayRead, zeroByteMessage, >4GB, GPU)
  + SocketTcp    (PBM, SGEs, -          , -         , zeroByteMessage,  1GB, -  )
  + SocketUdp    ( - ,  -  , -          , -         , -              , 64KB, -  )  unicast & multicast, send & recv
  - RdmaRC       (PBM, SGEs, oneWayWrite, oneWayRead, zeroByteMessage,  1GB, GPU)
  - RdmaUC       (PBM, SGEs, oneWayWrite, -         , zeroByteMessage,  1GB, GPU)
  - RdmaUD       (PBM, SGEs, -          , -         , zeroByteMessage,  MTU, GPU)  unicast & multicast, send & recv

Future:
  - Collectives: base on Takyon 1.x graph extension
    - Also create GUI to make graph design easy
  - Strided (maybe)
  - Publish/Subscribe
    - A potential replacement for the overly complex DDS. Goal is to cover most real-world DDS examples
    - Could still have participants, publishers, and subscribers, but messages are opaque (removes need for intermediate language)
    - Use a simplified QoS
