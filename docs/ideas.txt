To DO
  - Test with Infiniband and iWarp
  - BUG: OSX ephemeral sockets (seems the multicast packets are being blocked. Could just be a firewall)

Maybe
  - README: Refactor begining to show importance
  - Figure out how to do atomics with InterThread and InterProcess
  - Add Provider for Microsoft's Network Direct 2
  - Split throughput example into throughput-two_sided and throughput-one_sided
  - Split examples into: two_sided_reliable, two_sided_unreliable, one_sided_read, one_sided_write, one_sided_atomic

Known Issues:
  - RDMA GPUDirect does not seem to work if transfer is not at least 33 bytes. No response from NVIDIA's Mellanox group yet

Future Ideas
  - Collectives: base on Takyon 1.x graph extension
    - Also create GUI to make graph design easy
  - Strided (maybe)
  - Publish/Subscribe
    - A potential replacement for the overly complex DDS. Goal is to cover most real-world DDS examples
    - Could still have participants, publishers, and subscribers, but messages are opaque (removes need for intermediate language)
    - Use a simplified QoS
