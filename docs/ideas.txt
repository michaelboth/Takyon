To DO
  - BUG: OSX ephemeral sockets (seems the multicast packets are being blocked)
  - Ask Mellanox if Verbs is also on Windows
  - Provide a way to get capabilities before path is created? Add function in supported_providers.h?
  - Compile out error checking if in release mode
    - use #ifdef DEBUG_BUILD where appropriate
  - Allow InterThread and InterProcess to have unreliable modes; i.e. if recv not posted, data is dropped.
  - DOC:
    - sent bytes can be less posted recv request
    - refresh: e.g. one-sided can have multiple buffers
    - Staging: show 'hello-two_sided' build and run with MMAP/CUDA

Future Ideas
  - Atomics
  - Collectives: base on Takyon 1.x graph extension
    - Also create GUI to make graph design easy
  - Strided (maybe)
  - Publish/Subscribe
    - A potential replacement for the overly complex DDS. Goal is to cover most real-world DDS examples
    - Could still have participants, publishers, and subscribers, but messages are opaque (removes need for intermediate language)
    - Use a simplified QoS
