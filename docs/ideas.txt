To DO
  - BUG: OSX ephemeral sockets (seems the multicast packets are being blocked)

Promote To
  - Khronos, as a new proposal
  - Intel's RDMA group
  - Microsoft's Network Direct group
  - NVIDIA's Mellanox group
  - OFA: leads to many companies that are members
  - Mercury computers
  - Curtiss Wright
  - Huawei
  - Abaco

Future Ideas
  - Atomics
  - Collectives: base on Takyon 1.x graph extension
    - Also create GUI to make graph design easy
  - Strided (maybe)
  - Publish/Subscribe
    - A potential replacement for the overly complex DDS. Goal is to cover most real-world DDS examples
    - Could still have participants, publishers, and subscribers, but messages are opaque (removes need for intermediate language)
    - Use a simplified QoS
